## About Me

Hey! I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for cats, reading, and of course, web development. With skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Angular, I create engaging and functional web experiences.

Outside of work, I enjoy diving into a good book üìö and sharing my life with my adorable feline companions üêæ. I believe that my love for cats and reading shines through in my creative and unique approach to development projects.

Also, if you're interested, you can check out my [course notes](https://www.notion.so/cf691948eb5240d599c8ec821d6ab627?v=d89f8b9a2bc9421fa0e38827bc68917c&pvs=4) to see what I've been learning.

I'm thrilled to join an amazing team and contribute to the success of your company. Let's chat and create something awesome together! üöÄ
